Kraftvaerk.ZipLookUp
====================

Kraftvaer ZipLookUp is a property editor that is based on the API from http://www.zippopotam.us and it supports all of the 60 countries that is currently listed on the website.

Once the package is installed you can create a new property editor based on Kraftvaerk.ZipLookUp. By default it will be configured to use Great Britain and it will show place / city name in the lookup fields as default but you can enable the fields you would like to have populated automatically.
